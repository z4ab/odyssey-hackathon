# E-Mission
This website was created during the Odyssey Hackathon.

E-Mission highlights the emissions from government facilities in the city of Brampton to provide insight on who the biggest contributors are. Citizens and the government alike can track the progress made from the various climate related policies. This website uses the Google Maps API and presents an overlay based on Brampton's emissions data.
